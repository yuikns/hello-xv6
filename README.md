# Hello XV6

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

This repo contains a few helper funtion to start a few scripts to compile and run it in macOS
